		\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
	
	\hspace*{12pt}Gyms have become an essential part of our lives, providing the best exercise and body-building facilities to our society. Therefore, at the management end there are some necessary steps to maintain the records of every individual including a trainer, trainees, and staff but maintaining the records on paper is very difficult so, it is necessary to have a computerized system that manages all these issues. Gym Management Systems typically offer a wealth of solutions for every day operation, streamlining processes in a way that can enhance the customer experience. From online gym scheduling and automated billing to administrative tasks, the software pulls all data into one place so that you can run your business more efficiently. Gym management software is generally designed to streamline operations so that all of these tasks can be in one place. In a world where technological advances occur so quickly, it can feel like a challenge to keep up. But gym and fitness clubs can maximize business potential through gym management software. Simply, gym management software is a type of software that provides fitness businesses the functionality needed to manage all aspects of their business and efficiently operate their studio. Gym management software can also be referred to as club management software, fitness software, or gym scheduling software. Regardless of the nomenclature, these platforms all share similar feature sets and are used for the same purposes. Gym management software helps fitness owners and operators manage their class and trainer scheduling, keep track of their members, communicate with clients. Assuming clients enjoy the workouts and the sense of community at your studio, if the software is user friendly when they’re scheduling from a mobile app or on their computer, then they’ll continue to come back. The main objective of the Fitness Centre Management System is to manage the details of Fitness center, Fitness Master,  Member, Diets. It manages all the information about Fitness centre, Health, Diets. The project is controlling the administrator. The purpose of the project is to build an application program to reduce the manual work for managing the Fitness centre, Fitness Master, Health it tracks all the details about the Employee, Member, Diets. This project also incorporate bodymeasurements with the help of their photo using CNN Algorithm,and also find the nutrient content of food to capture an image then get the result.CNNs are powerful image processing, artificial intelligence (AI) that use deep learning to perform both generative and descriptive tasks, often using machine vision that includes image and video recognition, along with recommender systems and natural language processing (NLP).

	\section{General Background}
	
	
	
	\hspace*{12pt}“Health care” Fitness center follows traditional fitness Center Managements, there is no guarantee for a computers or system to keep record of the Customers to be present. There is no suitable timetable for customers  and their workout is not arranged properly. So, there can be a clash in daily schedules. Since the records are in written documents, it is difficult to find the user names, Workout timings, summary etc. Administrator will be having a poor control over the Gym. They Using Paper work and direct human language communication to manage the Gym System will create problems, in terms of member records and their transactions which minimize the overall performance of the system and do not fulfill the requirements.  \\
	
	\pagebreak
	
	\section{Objective}
	\hspace*{12pt}In the AI based fitness management system provides a computer-based management system for keeping all records about Machinery, Members, and manage Fitness center, Fitness Master, Member, Diets, Workouts. This system helps the Owner and Admin to maintain large data about users and their daily plans in the gym center. This system is helping in creating reports and other record. The system is also suitable for users for an online profile my Gym Management system is the best option for it. It reduces and removes the manual and traditional workload. Administrator can easily add/ delete/ update/view each record on the computer. Mainly this project also incorporates bodymeasuremets with the help of CNN Algorithm and also predict the nutrient content of food with the help of image capture.

		\section{Existing system}
		\hspace*{12pt}{\normalsize
	The majority of the current automobile rental systems deal with customers in a conventional manner. The Car Rental System service will help users book a car for a fee specified. There was no clear web-based UI to help users rent the vehicle until now. They had to manually rent the vehicle through their offices. In this approach, tracking the details of booked and registered automobiles is done manually through paper work or an excel sheet. The customer needs to submit his licence and Aadhar card as proof of his citizenship and address. A user must visit the office to rent a car and make reservations for a car. Consumers want to rent a specific car, but frequently they do not see the car they are planning to travel in and wind up renting something else, ruining their trip. The current system has a hand-to-hand payment option. The customer must go and make a cash payment. Here, communication is only possible face-to-face. If the user needs to rent a car but is busy or has an emergency, he cannot do it using the conventional approach unless he travels there. In the system, customers can hire drivers for rent if they need to.In the modern digital era, where everything is available online, this strategy is no longer viable.
	\\
		
			
	\\
		\section{Proposed system}
	\hspace*{12pt}The online car rental system is a system for Symphony Car Rental, Kozhikode to automate the existing manual system. This system is a web-based application based on the concept of allowing customers to rent cars and drivers. The proposed system is being designed so that the work will become easier, faster, and more reliable than before. The major goal of the proposed system is to enhance and upgrade the existing systems with more efficiency, effectiveness, and also with low cost. 
	\\
	\hspace*{12pt}To access the homepage, admin must first log in. From the main page, the admin can add or update data. The system offers an admin-only part where vehicles and their details can be added, updated, or deleted. Admin can access the feedback and inquiry section to view user feedback and inquiries and respond to them. Admin can view available vehicles and drivers.The admin can view bookings made by customers and also can update their booking statuses.  
	
	To access the primary system, a user must first register and log in. Only after gaining access will they be able to select from a variety of car models and rent them out for a set period of time. With just a few clicks, customers can find everything on their internet-connected device. A user can quickly do a query in the system that is Speaking of the system's features, a user can choose among the various cars after logging in. The system shows the selected car's details when a selection has been made. The user must then enter information such as the number of days they plan to rent an automobile. Following these steps, the system verifies the rent. Customers can also rent drivers and can view profiles, select the driver and make contact. The Car Rental System takes care of all the inconveniences associated with traditional methods, which combine human interaction. No more phone calls or office visits, unlike current systems. Simply open the website, look through the cars, choose, and reserve. The customer would be given the best service available while saving time. Using this technique, the customer can easily obtain the car whenever they require it. Just a working internet connection is all they require. The system makes it simple for users to conduct inquiries. Inquiry is essentially an automated and computerised operation, which makes it much faster than it was in the past. Additionally, the client can leave feedback. Feedback is private information that can only be viewed by the admin.

	           	\section{Feasibility Study}
	           	\hspace*{12pt}A feasibility study is a preliminary investigation conducted to ascertain and record the viability of a project. The purpose and logical goal of this study is to identify the advantages and disadvantages of a current or proposed system, as well as the possibilities and risks that exist in the surrounding environment. A feasibility study considers numerous limitations that the system should be operated and developed within. In order to establish whether the identified user's needs can be met using current software and hardware technologies, an estimate is made in this study, including the resource needed for implementation and expenses at the earliest possible time. Additionally, this analysis will determine whether the suggested system can be created within the available financial limits and will be cost-effective from a commercial standpoint. The study's findings are considered while deciding whether to move forward with the project or not.
	           	\\
	\subsection{Operational Feasibility}
	\hspace*{12pt}Operational feasibility examines how a project plan satisfies the requirements identified in requirements analysis phase of system development. It refers to the feasibility of the product to be operational. It mainly focuses on how the system satisfies the user needs. It helps in taking advantage of the opportunities and fulfills the requirements as identified during the development of the project. The new system or project can be used in day to day life which becomes more user friendly for the customer. This system is operationally feasible as it is very easy to operate. It helps the Shop owner to manage the operations in the shop. Also, the customers can easily view and book cars and drivers. 
	\\
		\subsection{Technical Feasibility}
	\hspace*{12pt}Technical feasibility study deals with the hardware and software and technology which are required to accomplish the user requirements in the system with in the allocated time and budget.The proposed system requires HTML, CSS, Python and MySQL platform   open source. Due to open source of languages it may not become complex to maintain and develop the system. The system can also be easily upgraded to the higher level with less effort and maintenance. This application can be easily used with their laptops or phones anywhere and also this application is very much user friendly. Hence the proposed work is technically feasible.
	\\
	\subsection{Economic Feasibility}
	\hspace*{12pt}Economic feasibility determines whether the proposed system is capable of generating profit for an organization. It involves costs incurred on the development team, estimated cost of hardware, feasibility study, and so on. This application was developed with the available resources. Since cost of input for the system is almost zero. The output of the website is always a profit for the user, and we see this as a service. This website doesn't cost any money from the users who are accessing it. Since the application can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, there is no need for specific hardware. Hence, it is economically feasible.
